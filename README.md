# Classic Consoles Shop
This was a collaborative group project made in December 2019 for my Intro to Databases class. As of Jan. 25, 2020 the website is live at https://cosc304.ok.ubc.ca/75488726/tomcat/lab10/index.jsp

### Technologies Used
This project was made to test our recently learned skills with SQL and JDBC. Furthermore, we took the initiative to use Bootstrap to design our website. 

### Features
The main feature of this website is the shop page itself. It queries the database using JDBC and SQL to display the products. Products can be filtered by decade of release. Furthermore, products can be added to the shopping cart from this page or the user can click on the prodcut to go to the dedicated product page.

The cart page allows the users to modify the quantity products they have in the cart, or remove them.

The checkout page will then give the user an overview of their order once it has been placed.

For the administrator of the page, the admin can view various statistics of their shop such as users and daily sales.
